# YOLOv5-PDLPR algorithm

## Task
The objective of this project is to design and implement a deep learning-based system for license plate recognition, following the methodology outlined in [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/9/2791)]. The proposed solution is structured as a two-stage pipeline, leveraging the strengths of different neural network architectures to address the distinct subtasks involved in the recognition process.

- In the **first stage**, a **YOLOv5** model is employed for license plate detection, allowing for fast and accurate localization of the plate region within vehicle images, even under challenging environmental conditions.

- In the **second stage**, the cropped plate region is passed to a specialized recognition model based on the **PDLPR** architecture. This model is responsible for decoding the sequence of alphanumeric characters on the plate, effectively treating the task as a sequence prediction problem.

The integration of these two components aims to deliver a robust and efficient system for plate recognition and reconstruction suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios.

## Main Objectives

- **Baseline implementation, training and evaluation**  
  Implement a simple baseline, train and evaluate it with the metrics used in [[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/9/2791)].

- **YOLOv5 and PDLPR model implementation and evaluation**  
  Implement the proposed model in [1], composed of the YOLOv5 and PDLPR models, and evaluate it.

- **Comparison with the baseline**  
  Compare the performance of the proposed model with the baseline, underlining why the proposed model works better or not on recognizing and reconstructing the car plates.
